⏳ Backend part of Marvel school projet (based on Marvel API - comics & characters)  
👀 Look at the frontend repo!

## Welcome in my Marvel school project 👩🏿‍🎤🥷🏼🦹🏻‍♀️

The Marvel Universe is a fictional universe where the stories in most American comic book titles and other media published by Marvel Comics take place. Super-teams such as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Defenders, the Midnight Sons, and many Marvel superheroes live in this universe, including characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, Captain America, Wolverine, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Black Widow, Ghost Rider, Blade, the Silver Surfer, Nova, Daredevil, Iron Fist, the Moon Knight, the Punisher and Deadpool, among numerous others.

### My work?

To code a backend (and a frontend 👉🏻 look at the repo) based on a Marvel API. We have to take data from Marvel API directly into the backend project.  
Endpoints to build:

- List of Marvel's comics
- List of Marvel's characters
- List of all the comics per character
- Search bar (by name and title)
- Pagination
- Authentification: login and signup (cookies)

## Stacks

JavaScript, Node.js  
Express  
MongoDB

🙏🏻 Thank you @LeReacteur.
